warm-up:
convert the starting message using morse code to hex
turn the hex into base32
turn that to english for a discord invite to the hub (https://discord.gg/G9KRZ7M)

step 1:
open the first image file as text and find the message to the starting discord invite (https://discord.gg/RvFyfVT)
change the color balance of the image to find the numbers "seven five three six four nine"
use the numbers as the key for caesar cipher to each line in the message
convert the caesar cipher message using the changed alphabet to get a youtube channel link
check the channel description for a code that can be translated using Base32
convert Base32 into a private youtube video link                                                                                       
record the audio file and import it into an audio visualizer to see an image from the audio
the audio image reveals a drobox link to a text file that can be converted into an image
change the brightness of the image and then increase the saturation
de-swirl the image to find a link to a series of images and the first letter to the final discord (H)
the new images must be pieced together to reveal a message of numbers and letters
translate the message using hex and get a message to send to the bot (iLOVEscf999)
unlock verification for step 2

step 2:
use the first letter of each line in the poem to know you need caesar cipher 7
take each capital letter from the second story to translate with the caesar cipher
reverse the code used in the third story and add it onto the fourth
look in the description of channel 3 for the secret letter (F)
dm the bot the finished code for access to step 3 (trebombisepic3850197)

step 3:
deswirl the first image and then flip it upside down
copy the message backwards to see a youtube video link
screenshot the youtube video and increase the brightness and saturation then add an h to cipher
get a link to a new series of images on an imgur page
each image has its own number title for the order
image 4 contains the secret letter (j)
convert each image to reveal a set of letters and numbers
combine the codes from each image in order to get a message to send to the bot (giveROBUX1)
send the bot the message to get into step 4

step 4:
invert the 0s and the 1s in the binary
translate the binary into ascii
use the ascii for a google sites link
browse the website to find the first piece
convert the hex into morse
change the morse into text and get a google sites link
take each image from the google sites and piece it together to get the second piece                                
follow the youtube link and go to an unlisted video
check the comments for a message in base64
base64 sends you to a google docs link
highlight the text to see white messages in ascii85
turn the ascii85 into text to get a google slides presentation
take the image from the google presentation as the third piece
convert the tap code into hex
convert the hex into base32
convert the base 32 back into hex
convert the hex into morse
convert the morse into text
follow the link to gyazo with the fourth piece
view the image with 26 symbols as the alphabet plus 10 numbers on the bottom
inspect the file code for a link to a youtube video
translate each image on the youtube video using the alphabet
get a gyazo link to the fifth piece 
put together all 5 pieces to get the code for the bot as well as another letter for the final code
gain access to step 5 by sending the puzzle message to the bot (iAMsoCLOSE)

step 5:
translate the beeps into morse code
turn the morse code into hex
follow a hyperlink in the doc to an image
turn the image to text and get letters 1, 2, 3
convert the base64 on screen into binary
turn the binary into hex
translate the hex into text for letters 4, 5, 6
screenshot the image and deswirl it for letter 7
screenshot the image and brighten it for letters 8, 9
view the alert at the bottom of the screen for the next secret letter
reverse the tts audio for letter 10
translate the message on screen from a1z26
turn a1z26 to text for letters 11, 12, 13, 14
notice the letters on the building in the video for letters 15, 16, 17
flip the video right side up and see the text for letters 18, 19, 20
read the words in the roblox map for the order of capitals on the words
enter the words into the bot for access to step 6 (okTHISisBORINGnowLOL)

step 6:
change integer(U8) to base32
translate base32 into base64
convert the base64 to binary ascii
change the binary to morse
turn the morse into hex
convert the hex using caesar cipher 8 (haveafun)
translate the message using ROT47 to reveal the final characters and a message that it is all the link to the final server
